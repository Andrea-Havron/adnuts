# adnuts
An R package for NUTS sampling using TMB and ADMB

This is an in-development and very rough R package to conduct Bayesian analyses using either TMB or ADMB. For now, install using:

````devtools::install_github("colemonnahan/adnuts", ref="dev")````

This code comes with no garuantees and will change over the next few months.
